# 🚀 Space Missions Dashboard – A Power BI Exploration

Hi there! 👋  
This dashboard is one of the very first projects I built while getting hands-on with Power BI. As someone who's always been fascinated by the stars and space exploration, I thought—why not combine my curiosity for the cosmos with data?

I hopped on Kaggle, found an intriguing dataset related to global space missions, and got to work. The result? A data visualization project that dives into missions from NASA, ISRO, SpaceX, and other space agencies around the world.


## 🛰️ Dataset at a Glance

The dataset includes mission records from various space-faring nations and covers:

- Different mission types (manned vs. unmanned)
- Budget trends across agencies
- Success rates over time
- Use of advanced technologies like AI navigation and reusable rockets
- Environmental impact of each mission

### 🧾 Here’s What Each Column Represents:

| Column               | What It Means                                               |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Country**           | The nation involved in the mission                          |
| **Year**              | Year the mission was launched (2000–2024)                   |
| **Mission Name**      | The name of the mission                                     |
| **Mission Type**      | Manned or unmanned mission                                  |
| **Launch Site**       | The location where the mission launched                     |
| **Satellite Type**    | Purpose: Communication / Navigation / Research              |
| **Budget (in Billion $)** | Budget for the mission (in USD billions)               |
| **Success Rate (%)**  | How successful the mission was (percentage)                 |
| **Technology Used**   | Key tech: Reusable Rockets, AI Navigation, Solar Propulsion |
| **Environmental Impact** | Rated Low / Medium / High based on emissions, etc.      |


## 🧰 Tools I Used

- **Power BI** for building the dashboard and visuals
- **Excel / Power Query** for cleaning and shaping the data
- **Kaggle** for sourcing the dataset

## 🌱 What’s Next?

This is just the beginning! I'd love to:
- Bring in real-time data through APIs
- Add agency-to-agency comparisons
- Predict mission success using machine learning (why not?)
